## Git and GitHub Intro 

I've already known about Git and GitHub, but I haven't payed attention to it. It was a big mistake because now I understand that it is a great tool for development as it helps you not to be afraid of breaking something in your project. Moreveover, GitHub gives you a great opportunity to collaborate with other developers.

The course on Udacity was good and I really enjoyed try.github.io.

## Linux, CLI and HTTP

In this task I've learned some new things about CLI such as redirection of output, input and how to configure your own environment in CLI. Moreover, HTTP was a new thing for me. Now I know a little bit about how browser communicates with other machines on the Internet.

## Git Collaboration

This course was interesting for me. I've learned new things in Git. I really liked the `--oneline` flag for `git log` command. Also it is really good that it was explained how to undo your commits. I think `git commit --amend` and `git reset` are frequently used in practice.

It was really useful to complete this course because I refreshed my knowledge of GitHub and I got a better understanding of it. Moreover, this course explains greatly how to contribute in open-source projects.
