# Git and GitHub Intro 

I've already known about Git and GitHub, but I haven't payed attention to it. It was a big mistake because now I understand that it is a great tool for development as it helps you not to be afraid of breaking something in your project. Moreveover, GitHub gives you a great opportunity to collaborate with other developers.

The course on Udacity was good and I really enjoyed try.github.io.
